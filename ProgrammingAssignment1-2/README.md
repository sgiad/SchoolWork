   Description:
   I was asked to create an object-oriented application that prompt the 
   user for a valid name, ID number, hourly pay rate (default rate would 
   be entered if user did not input anything), hours worked, and if the
   employee is a senior or not. After getting that info from the user, an
   employee report would be displayed showing that info. After displaying
   employee's report, the user would be asked if he/she wants to enter
   another employee's info (YES/NO question). If yes, then the user will 
   be prompted again for employee's name, ID number, hourly pay rate, 
   hours worked, and whether the employee is a senior or not. However, 
   if no, the application will display a final report that shows total of
   employees entered and total amount of payrolls for all employees. After
   that a goodbye message shows up to close up the application.
